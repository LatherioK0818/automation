# Automation

## LAB - Class 19

### Authors: Latherio Kidd

### Overview

This project is designed to automate various tasks to improve organization and efficiency. It includes handling user data, sorting files, parsing logs, and executing miscellaneous tasks through Python scripts. Our goal is to streamline the workflow for our team by automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

### Setup

#### `.env` requirements (where applicable)


#### How to initialize/run your application

```bash
python automation.py
```

#### How to use your library (where applicable)

### Feature Tasks and Requirements

- **Automate the creation of a folder:** Write a Python script to create a new folder with a specified name.
- **Handle a deleted user:** Move documents from a deleted user's folder to a temporary folder, effectively deleting the user from the system while maintaining a record of their documents.
- **Sort documents into appropriate folders:** Sort documents into additional folders based on their file type. Create necessary folders if they don't exist.
- **Parse a log file for errors and warnings:** Parse a log file for errors and warnings, creating two separate log files in a target directory for errors and warnings respectively.
- **Create a menu-driven application:** Offer the user a list of automation tasks and allow them to choose one to execute. Incorporate an additional automation task of your choice.
